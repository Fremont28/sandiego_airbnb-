Examining Airbnb's expansion in San Diego 

Airbnb is increasingly becoming a mainstream option for vacationers and workers across the U.S. In some cities, including New York City and San Francisco, local residents and city officials have argued that Airbnb is driving up housing and rental prices by taking away available housing in urban neighborhoods.

Another growing city, San Diego, is also experiencing a boost on the Airbnb marketplace. According to Inside Airbnb, a website that scrapes rental data from Airbnbâ€™s website, a number of San Diegans are opting to rent out their apartments or houses on Airbnb. Over 30% of Airbnb listings consisted of new hosts (between July 2015 to July 2016) in the majority of neighborhoods in San Diego with at least 100 listings.
